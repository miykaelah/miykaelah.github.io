		<hr>
		<p>The idea for hunt + gather grew out of the realization that one thing that comes naturally to me is finding cool places and fun things to do and delicious things to eat and drink wherever I am, whether it's in the middle of rural New York State, in a bustling metropilis in India, strolling down the street in Madrid or just kickin' it in the heartland - my native KC. Often, I would find myself typing up extensive itineraries for friends for fun, and then I realized, why don't I just make a fun, interactive website with all this information? So here we go. I do the hunting for cool places and gathering of good information, and you just enjoy!</p>
